# CaesarCipherJR
This project is a console-based application for encrypting and decrypting text using the Caesar cipher. The main functionalities of the project are:

Encrypting text - Users can input a text file and a key to generate an encrypted version of the text.
Decrypting text - Users can input an encrypted text file and a key to retrieve the original, decrypted text.
Brute Force key search - The application can attempt to decrypt an encrypted text file by trying all possible keys, searching for a meaningful output.
The program supports multiple languages, allowing users to switch between Russian, English, and Ukrainian alphabets.
